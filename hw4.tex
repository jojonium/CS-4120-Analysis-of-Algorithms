\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
		We assume $G$ does not contain a cycle where the total cost of all edges
		in the cycle is negative because the concept of a shortest path is
		meaningless in a graph with negative-weight cycles.

		\textbf{Algorithm}:

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Remove $e$ from the graph, such that $G' = (V, E \; \backslash
				\; e)$. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path
				between $s$ and $t$ on $G'$ and store it as $S_1$.
			\item Let $u$ be the starting node of $e$. Use Dijkstra's algorithm
				to find the shortest path between $s$ and $u$ and store it as
				$S_2$.
			\item Let $v$ be the ending node of $e$. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to
				find the shortest path between $v$ and $t$ on $G$ and store it
				as $S_3$.
			\item Return $\min ( S_1, S_2 + \textrm{value}(e) + S_3 )$.
		\end{enumerate}

		\textbf{Analysis of Running Time}:

		The running time of Dijkstra's Algorithm is analyzed in ``Algorithm
		Design'' by Jon Kleinberg and Éva Tardos as $O(m \log n)$. The algorithm
		above merely uses Dijkstra's algorithm three times, giving it a time
		complexity of $O(3m \log n)$, which simplifies to $O(m \log n)$.

		\textbf{Proof of Correctness}:

		There are two possible scenarios: either $e$ is in the shortest path
		between $s$ and $t$, or it is not.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item If $e$ is not in the shortest path, step (a) above will
				correctly find the shortest by using Dijkstra's Algorithm on a
				graph without $e$. The correctness of Dijkstra's Algorithm is
				proven in ``Algorithm Design'' by Jon Kleinberg and Éva Tardos.
			\item If $e$ is in the shortest path, then we can split the shortest
				path into three segments: the path from $s$ to $u$, $e$, and the
				path from $v$ to $t$. Dijkstra's Algorithm correctly finds the
				solution to the first and third segments, and the second segment
				is simply the weight of $e$. Summing these correctly computed
				sub-problems will give us the correct optimal solution.
		\end{itemize}
