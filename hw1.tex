\begin{enumerate}
	\item Functions ordered by ascending order of growth rate:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $f_2(n) = \sqrt{2n}$
			\item
			\item
			\item
			\item
			\item
			\item
		\end{itemize}

	\item Proof by contradiction
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Suppose $G$ is not a tree.
			\item If $G$ has less than $n-1$ edges it cannot also be connected.
			\item Because $G$ is connected but not a tree, it must contain a
				cycle.
			\item Remove an edge from the cycle. We are left with a connected
				graph with $n-2$ edges, which is impossible.
		\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Efficient Algorithm}: Do a breadth-first search of $G$,
		remembering each vertex you have seen. If you ever see a vertex twice,
		$G$ contains a cycle

		\textbf{Proof of Correctness}:
